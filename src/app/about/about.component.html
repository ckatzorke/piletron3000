<div>
  Piletron 3000&trade; is a non commercial, non serious side project done by Christian Katzorke.
  <br> I am an agile solution architect, software developer (professional), movie nerd, video game player (leisure time) and
  loving father of three (all time). This leads inevitable to one serious issue:
  <strong>pile of shames everywhere!</strong>
  <br> I came up with the idea to visualize and materialize your pile of shame.

  The name
  <strong>Piletron 3000</strong> is inspired by Ron Gilbert's incredible awesome point & click adventure revivial
  <strong>Thimbleweed Park</strong>. It is available on almost any platform, so no excuse to play it - if you look back with joy
  to game highlights like
  <strong>Monkey Islannd</strong> or
  <strong>Day of the Tentacle</strong>, go and play
  <strong>Thimbleweed Park</strong>.
